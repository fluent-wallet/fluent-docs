# Fluent developer documentation

This is the Fluent developer documentation repository.
The documentation site is hosted at [docs.fluentwallet.com](https://doc.fluentwallet.com), and it's
built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator purpose-built for
technical documentation.
