# Integrate with the Fluent wallet

Integrate your dapp with the Fluent wallet using the
[Fluent Conflux provider API](reference/provider-api.md), which enables your dapp to interact
with its users' Conflux accounts.
We recommend using [@fluent-wallet/detect-provider](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@fluent-wallet/detect-provider) to easily enable your users to connect to their
Fluent wallet client from any platform.

Get started by [setting up your development environment](get-started/set-up-dev-environment.md).

## What is the Fluent Conflux provider API?

The [Fluent Conflux provider API](reference/provider-api.md) is a JavaScript API that Fluent
injects into websites visited by Fluent users.
Your dapp can use this API to request users' Conflux accounts, read data from blockchains the user
is connected to, and suggest that the user sign messages and transactions.

## Questions?

If you have questions about integrating your dapp with Fluent Wallet, you can interact with the Fluent
team and community on the Fluent Wallet issues on [Fluent Issues](https://github.com/Conflux-Chain/helios/issues) or [Zendesk](https://fluent-wallet.zendesk.com/hc/en-001/requests/new).
